# Contributing

This document contains information and guidelines about contributing to the [FlowOver Stack](https://github.com/mayorJAY/FlowOverStack) project. Please read it before you start participating.

## Contributing Code

To start contributing to the codebase, first fork the repository. Branches are made off of `development` with each feature or issue per branch. Once done, take a look at open [Issues](https://github.com/mayorJAY/FlowOverStack/issues), pick anyone you're comfortable with, code it out and submit a Pull Request. I will review the code and respond if changes should be made.

## Submitting an Issue

Please feel free to open an issue if you find something that make you unhappy with the application. It can as well be a feature request - you think there is a particular feature that should be on the application, just pen it down [here](https://github.com/mayorJAY/FlowOverStack/issues).

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere by and respect the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mayorJAY/FlowOverStack/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
